FN 1
input is array of votes and date of election
    Idea: If no input from starting program -> allow user to make array in program
returns checksum and vote total

FN2 
input is that same array and election date
alter array so that:
  Ham Burgler Wins
  Vote Count remains the same
  Checksum remains the same
