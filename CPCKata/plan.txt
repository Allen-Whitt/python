FN 1
input is array of votes and date of election
    Idea: If no input from starting program -> allow user to make array in program
  get array
  calculate checksum and vote total
returns the checksum and vote total given an array of votes and the date of the election

FN2 
input is that same array and election date
alter array so that:
  Ham Burgler Wins
  Vote Count remains the same
  Checksum remains the same

  calculate if changes can be made 
    both through checksum and vote total
      this is the hard part... Need to figure out how I am going to do this.

      So, mathematically it's checksum is (66b + 82r)/356 = (66B + 82R)/356  where b+r = B+R and B>R
        66b+82r = 66B+82R
        (82r - 82R) = (66B - 66b)
        82(r-R)/66 = (B-b)
        41/33 *(r-R) = (B-b)
        But we also know r-R = B-b 
          41/33(r-R) = (r-R)
          41r - 41R = 33r - 33R
          8r - 8R = 0

          that's going nowhere...

        I can use modulus: So I could count up the ways to make it such that whatever number is 356
          more than the given set
            82-66 = 16
            the least common multiple of them is 2706
    
    return the number of votes that needs to be changed in the array
    
  make changes if applicable

  return new array


  change vote number:

3b + 2r / 16

LCM 6

[ r r r r b b ]

2b 3r

17 % 16 = 1

12+4 == 0

9+ 6 == 15

6+8 == 14

3 10 == 13

OKAY So, if I think of these as sets: I can think of them like this:
  anything mod 4 will be in [0123] and everything WILL repeat so I can treat it like a set
  that repeats itself. if I have a set of 10 votes my math for all the calculations will be

3b 2r

30 0 > 2
27 2 > 1
24 4 > 0
21 6 > 3
18 8 > 2 
15 10 > 1
12 12 > 0
9 14 > 3
6 16 > 2 
3 18 > 1
0 20 > 0

so the pattern repeats in decending order
if I did 4 votes instead
12 0 > 0
9 2 > 3
6 4 > 2
3 6 > 1
0 8 > 0

So the number of votes will determine where the pattern starts...
1 > 3,2
2 > 2,1,0
3 > 1,0,3,2
4 > 0,3,2,1,0
10 > 2,1,0,3,2,1,0,3,2,1,0
  The pattern at the beginning will repeat itself at the beginning, also for 
  another thing in the set to appear it must have at least the same number of votes as the election day
  
  okay so what do I need to get from the first 0 in the 10 to the next one?
   i need + election date at least so I only need to look at the number i have plus the nubmer of 
   election dates ahead.
   The thing that I have tells me the minimum number of votes need to be cast for Burgler to win
   while maintaing checksum and vote count
