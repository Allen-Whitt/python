FN 1
input is array of votes and date of election
    Idea: If no input from starting program -> allow user to make array in program
  get array
  calculate checksum and vote total
returns checksum and vote total

FN2 
input is that same array and election date
alter array so that:
  Ham Burgler Wins
  Vote Count remains the same
  Checksum remains the same

  calculate if changes can be made 
    both through checksum and vote total
      this is the hard part... Need to figure out how I am going to do this.
  make changes 

  return new array
